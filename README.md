# Synthesis
A framework and GUI to construct a single Bethesda game patch from many patcher sources. Designed to allow any program to work as a patcher as long as it conforms to the CLI API.

## Installation
If you're looking to install, we have a [wiki page](https://github.com/Noggog/Synthesis/wiki/Installation) with the details.

Also be sure to head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/53KMEsW) and ask any and all questions you may have!

## Development
While Synthesis supports any external program as a patcher, it heavily facilitates creating and running Mutagen-based patchers.
Take a look at the [Development](https://github.com/Noggog/Synthesis/wiki/Create-a-Mutagen-Patcher) side of the wiki, the [Mutagen](https://github.com/Noggog/Mutagen/wiki) documentation, or some [example patchers](https://github.com/Noggog/Synthesis/network/dependents).
