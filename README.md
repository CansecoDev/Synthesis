## Installation
If you're looking to install, we have a [wiki page](https://github.com/Noggog/Synthesis/wiki/Installation) with the details.

Currently there is not much in the way of official documentation.  This will be filled out as the app begins to exit the alpha stage.  In the meantime, head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/53KMEsW) and ask any and all questions you may have!
