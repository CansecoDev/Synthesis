# Install .NET 7.0 SDK
Currently, the latest version .NET 7.0.4 (SDK v7.0.202) has a bug.  The current installation recommendations are to go to this gritty page:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0

And grab `7.0.3 (SDK7.0.2.01)` specifically

### Try to NOT install/uninstall multiple SDKs repeatedly
If after installing the .NET 7.0 SDK as instructed above it doesn't work, try following [this FAQ first](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/discussions/135)

# Restart
It's usually a good idea to restart your computer after installing DotNet SDK.  Helps things settle in.

# Download Synthesis
Currently the place to go is [the release page](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases)

On the latest release, download _just_ the **Synthesis.zip** file.  The other files are not needed.

Unzip the archive somewhere you like.  Make sure you bring along ALL the files within the zip, not just `Synthesis.exe`

It will create a few files nearby itself, so it is good to put it within its own folder.

# Run Synthesis
You're ready to run Synthesis!
